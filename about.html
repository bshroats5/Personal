I am a Technical Support Specialist II at the University of Kentucky Center for Innovation in Population Health dedicated to helping train and educate Child and Adult Mental and Behavioral 
Specialists all over the World. My passion lies in helping others be their best self, and I believe that by working in the background and supporting them is the best way to make a 
difference. With over 3 years of experience in Technical Support and Data Analysis, I specialize in turning complex problems into elegant, user-friendly solutions. 
When Iâ€™m not at my desk, you can usually find me at a stadium with my family. Whether it is my daugher playing softball or going to a sporting event with my family, 
I love being part of the action.
