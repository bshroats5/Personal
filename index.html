            Hello World! My name is Bret Shroats and I am a student of life. I am always looking to learn new things. I recently switched my focus from Web Development to Data Analytics. <br>
            I love my God, my family, and my sports teams. I would love to connect with you. Please continue to surf the site to learn more.
